# Non-Crossing Disc Partitions and their Kreweras Complements (p5.js)

Interactive visualization of non-crossing partitions on the disc. 

**Play with it here:** https://spoodermon.github.io/p5-nc-partitions/

## Instructions:
1. Press `spacebar` to toggle between the partition, $\pi$ and its Kreweras complement $\mathrm{Kr}(\pi)$
2. Press `enter` to input your own valid non-crossing partition, then press `enter` once again.

**Note:** The non-crossing partition must be of valid form, in particular its input must be in cycle notation e.g. $(1\ 4)(2\ 3)(5\ 10)(6\ 7\ 8\ 9)$ where cycles are delimited by brackets `(`, `)` and elements in the brackets are delimited by spaces ` `. The program will verify whether the partition indeed has support on $[n]$ and check the non-crossing condition.
